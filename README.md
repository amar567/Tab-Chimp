# Tab-chimp

## I am trying to build a browsing session manager for chrome, which supports tab groups

This is just a prelimnary attempt

## TODO

    - Save session
    - Save Tabgroup as bookmark folder
    - Create session using groups and tabs from Previous sessions [drag and drop stuff]
    - More work needs to go in sidepanel
    - Custom navigation shortcuts 
    - Sync across devices
